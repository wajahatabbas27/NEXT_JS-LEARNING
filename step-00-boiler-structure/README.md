# Boiler starter for nextjs

- npx create-next-app <project-name> --use-npm

- to run the server it requires : - npm run dev or yarn dev

- In react we use react-router to navigate to the pages all the way, but here its simple to route and for that we have have a pages folder whatever is there inside the pages folder will be considered as the route to a different page.

- we can also put all our data which we require in the public page e.g : components folder , utility functions folder, assets and much more.

## Typescript

- To use typescript we just need to initialize the tsconfig.json file then,

It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have
the required package(s) installed.
Please install typescript and @types/react by running:
npm install --save typescript @types/react
If you are not trying to use TypeScript, please remove
the tsconfig.json file from your package root (and any
TypeScript files in your pages directory).

- The we need to install these packages

## Babel && Webpack

- Babel only takes modern code as input and produces backward-compatible scripts as output. It works as the Transpiler.

- Webpack takes the whole code and creates the bundle for that.

### pages

- We can use the rafce in the pages to work just need to learn the structure, and everything is good and working fine all the way.
